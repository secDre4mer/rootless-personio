# "Rootless" Personio API client

Accessing [Personio's API](https://developer.personio.de/docs)
requires API credentials [which does not scope to the employee level](https://developer.personio.de/discuss/634e4b08a3f8d80051c52cfe),
meaning you can only get official API access as an admin user,
where you get access to the sensitive information of all the employees in your
company.

Instead, this package uses a different API: the same API as your web browser.
This is done by pretending to be a browser and logging in normally using
email and password.

## About this repo

Thanks to the [new EU ruling](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/global-hr/pages/eu-mandatory-time-tracking.aspx),
time tracking is now even more mandatory than it was before. Some companies,
like where I work, have first now started enforcing time tracking.

Initially this didn't bother me though, as I've been tracking my time for years
on my own. But now we must start reporting our tracked time to our HR system:
Personio.

So that sparked me to somehow access Personio's API, because I do NOT want to
sit there and manually transfer the tracked time via that slow
(albeit not the slowest) HR web interface.

## CLI

### Installing CLI

There is a CLI available that exposes some of the features found in the
Go library.

Currently, installing **requires that you have Go 1.20 (or later) installed.**
Then you can run the following:

```sh
go install github.com/applejag/rootless-personio@latest
```

### CLI usage

```console
$ rootless-personio --help
Access Personio via your own employee credentials,
instead of obtaining admin/root API credentials.

Usage:
  rootless-personio [command]

Available Commands:
  attendance  Group of commands for interacting with attendance
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  config      Prints the parsed config
  help        Help about any command
  raw         Send a raw HTTP request to the API

Flags:
      --auth.email string       Email used when logging in
      --config string           Config file (default is $HOME/.rootless-personio.yaml)
  -h, --help                    Show this help text
      --log.format log-format   Sets the logging format (default pretty)
      --log.level log-level     Sets the logging level (default warn)
      --no-login                Skip logging in before the request
  -o, --output out-format       Sets the output format (default pretty)
  -q, --quiet                   Disables logging (same as "--log.level disabled")
      --url string              Base URL used to access Personio
  -v, --verbose count           Shows verbose logging (-v=info, -vv=debug, -vvv=trace)

Use "rootless-personio [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

#### Update attendance (time tracking)

There are two ways to update your attendance periods:

1. **Using the CLI**: You can use the `rootless-personio attendance add` command
   to add an attendance period directly from the command line, e.g.:

   ```sh
    rootless-personio attendance add 2025-04-01 "my project" 8h
    ```

2. **Using a JSON file**: You can use the `rootless-personio attendance set`
   command to update your attendance periods in bulk using a JSON file.

```json
{
  "start": "2023-01-18T08:00:00Z",
  "end": "2023-01-18T12:00:00Z",
  "comment": "Work before lunch",
  "project": "my project",
  "period_type": "work"
}
{
  "start": "2023-01-18T12:00:00Z",
  "end": "2023-01-18T13:00:00Z",
  "comment": "Lunch break",
  "period_type": "break"
}
{
  "start": "2023-01-18T13:00:00Z",
  "end": "2023-01-18T17:00:00Z",
  "comment": "Work after lunch",
  "period_type": "work"
}
```

```sh
rootless-personio attendance set --file file-with-stream.json
```

> By "JSON stream", I mean where the JSON objects are defined one after
> each other, instead of wrapping all objects in a big array.
>
> If you have your attendance periods in an array, you can convert it into
> a JSON stream with the following [`jq`](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
> command:
>
> ```sh
> jq '.[]' file-with-array.json > file-with-stream.json
> ```

This operation can be combined with other time-tracking tools, such as
[dinkur](https://github.com/dinkur/dinkur), as long as you figure out how
to export your time tracking data, and reshape it to look like the above JSON:

```sh
dinkur ls -r all -o json \
  | jq '.[] | .comment=.name | del(.id, .createdAt, .updatedAt, .name)' \
  | rootless-personio attendance set -f -
```

Or something like this, if you're using [timetrap](https://github.com/samg/timetrap):

```sh
timetrap display --format json \
  | jq '.[] | .comment=.note | del(.id, .sheet, .note)' \
  | rootless-personio attendance set -f -
```

### Configuration

The CLI is configured via YAML files.
See [`personio.yaml`](./personio.yaml) for the default values.

#### Configuration files

Certmgmt looks for config files in multiple locations, where the latter
overrides config fields from the former.

On Linux:

1. Default values *(see [`personio.yaml`](./personio.yaml))*
2. `/etc/personio/personio.yaml`
3. `~/.config/personio.yaml`
4. `~/.personio.yaml`
5. `.personio.yaml` *(in current directory)*

On Windows:

1. Default values *(see [`personio.yaml`](./personio.yaml))*
2. `%APPDATA%/personio.yaml`
3. `%USERPROFILE%/.personio.yaml`
4. `.personio.yaml` *(in current directory)*

On Mac:

1. Default values *(see [`personio.yaml`](./personio.yaml))*
2. `/etc/personio/personio.yaml`
3. `~/Library/Application Support/personio.yaml`
4. `~/.personio.yaml`
5. `.personio.yaml` *(in current directory)*

#### JSON Schema

There's also a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) for the config file,
which gives you warnings and completion support inside your IDE.

Make use of it via e.g:

- [YAML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml)
  for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- [coc-yaml plugin](https://github.com/neoclide/coc-yaml)
  for [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim),
  an extension framework for both Vim and NeoVim.

To make use of it, add the following comment to the beginning of your
config file:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://github.com/applejag/rootless-personio/raw/main/personio.schema.json
```
